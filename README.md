## Description
The professional README generator creates a professional README.md file based on dynamic user inputs pertinent to his/her project. Developers will be able to save time generating a README from scratch as the inquirer module will walk he/she through a list of questions that are required to generate a professional and all-encompassing README file.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
